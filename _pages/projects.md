## PhD Project (July 2022 – Present)
**Motor learning-based control of peripheral nerves for supernumerary degrees of freedom (sDoFs)**  
*Description:* The project focuses on using neural signals acquired non-invasively as an interface modality to control human augmentation devices. Decomposition of high-density surface electromyography yields individual motoneuron signals that augment the human output space with more degrees of control, ideal for controlling augmentation devices and the body's own parts simultaneously.  
*Keywords:* Human-Machine Interfacing, Neuroscience, HD EMG, Motor Unit Decomposition, Reinforcement Learning, Matlab, Python, Data Analysis

## Project (August 2022 – Present)
**Supernumerary Robotic Fingers for Assistance in Cylindrical and Pinch Grasps**  
*Description:* This project presents an assistive device comprising two supernumerary robotic fingers aimed at individuals with hand grasping limitations. The extra fingers assist in performing power grasps, such as cylindrical grips, in conjunction with the user’s palm, or precision grasps, like pinch grips. Actuated by servomotors, their positions are controlled by commands derived from the wearer’s wrist movements, providing a natural control interface that avoids using joints unrelated to the motor task.
