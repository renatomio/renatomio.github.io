I am a **doctoral researcher** at the **Chair of Digital Health with a Focus on Data Science** (University of Bayreuth, Germany) and a member of the **Brain and Behaviour Laboratory** at **Imperial College London, UK**. My research focuses on **non-invasive neural interfaces for human augmentation**, combining **machine learning** and **signal processing** techniques to analyse electromyography (EMG) recordings. By decoding muscle-related signals even at the individual neuron level, my goal is to expand the human output bandwith and improve control over EMG-based human-machine interfaces.

My past projects have explored various aspects of **human augmentation and rehabilitation technology**, including:  
- Studying how people learn to control an **additional robotic finger** while playing the piano.  
- Developing both **myoelectric** and **body-powered hand prostheses** to improve accessibility in prosthetic solutions.  
- Designing **supernumerary robotic fingers** to enhance grasping capabilities.  

Through my work, I aim to bridge the gap between **neuroscience, engineering, and assistive technology**, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in human augmentation.

Beyond academia, I am passionate about fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange. I co-founded and am currently a leader of the **Bayreuth AI Association**, a space for the open exchange of ideas and experiences in the hands-on use of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** with a focus on the practical implementation of algorithms through group projects.

I am also a **co-founder of LAT Bionics**, a Peru-based company committed to designing and fitting **low-cost, customised hand prostheses** for individuals with limb differences.

My projects have been featured in several media outlets from the UK, Peru, and Germany. **Scientific Reports**, **Imperial College News**, and major international media outlets like **Reuters** and **New Scientist**.
