I am a **doctoral researcher** at the **[Chair of Digital Health with a Focus on Data Science](https://www.digital-health.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html)** from the University of Bayreuth (Germany) and the **[Brain and Behaviour Laboratory](https://faisallab.org/)** at Imperial College London (UK). 

My research focuses on **non-invasive neural interfaces for human augmentation**, combining **machine learning** and **signal processing** techniques to analyse electromyography (EMG) recordings. By decoding muscle-related signals even at the individual neuron level, my goal is to expand the human output bandwith and improve control over EMG-based human-machine interfaces.

My past projects have explored various aspects of **human augmentation and rehabilitation technology**, including:  
- Studying how people learn to control an **additional robotic finger** while playing the piano.  
- Developing both **myoelectric** and **body-powered hand prostheses** to improve accessibility in prosthetic solutions.  
- Designing **supernumerary robotic fingers** to enhance grasping capabilities.  

Beyond academia, I am passionate about fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange. I co-founded and am currently a leader of the **[Bayreuth AI Association](https://www.ai-association.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html)**, a space for the open exchange of ideas and experiences in the hands-on use of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** with a focus on the practical implementation of algorithms through group projects.

I am also a **co-founder** of **[LAT Bionics](https://www.instagram.com/latbionics/)**, a company based in Peru committed to designing and fitting **low-cost, customised hand prostheses** for individuals with limb differences. You can learn more about our mission watching our [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/enzo_romero_the_affordable_3d_printed_bionics_of_the_future).

My projects have been featured in several media outlets from the UK, Peru, and Germany. **Scientific Reports**, **Imperial College News**, and major international media outlets like **Reuters** and **New Scientist**.
