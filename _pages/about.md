I am a **doctoral researcher** at the **[Chair of Digital Health with a Focus on Data Science](https://www.digital-health.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html)** from the University of Bayreuth (Germany) and the **[Brain and Behaviour Laboratory](https://faisallab.org/)** at Imperial College London (UK). 

My research focuses on **non-invasive neural interfaces for human augmentation**, combining **machine learning** and **signal processing** techniques to analyse electromyography (EMG) recordings. By decoding muscle-related signals even at the individual neuron level, my goal is to expand the human output bandwith and improve control over EMG-based human-machine interfaces.

My past projects have explored various aspects of **human augmentation and rehabilitation technology**, including:  
- Studying how people learn to control an **additional robotic finger** while playing the piano ([paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-00376-6)).
- Developing both **myoelectric** and **body-powered hand prostheses** to improve accessibility in prosthetic solutions ([paper 1](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-49407-9_62), [paper 2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8567461), [paper 3](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-16423-2_9), [paper 4](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10719816)).  
- Designing **supernumerary robotic fingers** to enhance grasping capabilities ([bpSRF](https://github.com/renatomio/bpSRF), [paper 1](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10162114), [paper 2](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-49407-9_52)).  

Beyond academia, I am passionate about fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange. I co-founded and am currently a leader of the **[Bayreuth AI Association](https://www.ai-association.uni-bayreuth.de/en/index.html)**, a space for the open exchange of ideas and experiences in the hands-on use of **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** with a focus on the practical implementation of algorithms through group projects. Our latest project was featured by [Kurier](https://www.kurier.de/inhalt.an-bayreuther-uni-ki-rechnet-an-der-mensa-die-essen-aus.9a64171f-0ad6-481a-9eb8-6f016e88c68f.html), [inFranken](https://www.infranken.de/lk/bayreuth/ki-in-der-mensa-der-uni-bayreuth-was-es-damit-auf-sich-hat-art-6087541), [Bayreuther Tagblatt](https://www.bayreuther-tagblatt.de/bayreuth-2/ki-in-der-bayreuther-mensa/) and [UBT](https://www.uni-bayreuth.de/pressemitteilung/ki-gegen-food-waste).

I am also a **co-founder** of **[LAT Bionics](https://www.instagram.com/latbionics/)**, a company based in Peru committed to designing and fitting **low-cost, customised hand prostheses** for individuals with limb differences. You can learn more about our mission watching our [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zhtl4Ava1fQ).

My projects have been featured in several media outlets from the UK, Peru, and Germany. **Scientific Reports**, **Imperial College News**, and major international media outlets like **Reuters** and **New Scientist**.
